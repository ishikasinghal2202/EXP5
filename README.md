AIM:
To study and implement C++ decision making statements

SOFTWARE USED:
VS Code

THEORY:
In C++, decision-making statements control the flow of a program based on specific conditions. These statements allow the program to evaluate expressions and decide which block of code to execute depending on whether a condition is true or false. This helps build intelligent programs that can react differently based on inputs, situations, or calculations.
Types of Decision-Making Statements:
- if Statement: Executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true. It's the most basic form of decision-making.
- if...else Statement: Provides an alternative path by specifying code to run when the condition is false.
- else if Ladder: Allows multiple conditions to be checked in sequence. Only the first true condition’s block gets executed.
- switch Statement: Used when you need to compare a single variable against multiple constant values. It’s cleaner and faster than using many else if conditions for discrete options.

CONCLUSION:
Decision-making statements are fundamental for writing flexible and intelligent C++ programs. They enable logic-based execution, allowing the program to make real-time choices based on given conditions.
