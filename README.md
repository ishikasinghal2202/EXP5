AIM:
To study and implement C++ decision making statements

SOFTWARE USED:
VS Code


OBJECTIVE:
            1.Understand control flow.
            2.Implement conditional logic.
            3.Improve problem-solving.
            4.Enhance code readability.


THEORY:

       -In C++, decision-making statements control the flow of a program based on specific conditions. 
       -These statements allow the program to evaluate expressions and decide which block of code to execute depending on whether a condition is true or false. 
       -This helps build intelligent programs that can react differently based on inputs, situations, or calculations.

       
Types of Decision-Making Statements:
            

     - if Statement: Executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true. It's the most basic form of decision-making.
     - if...else Statement: Provides an alternative path by specifying code to run when the condition is false.
     - else if Ladder: Allows multiple conditions to be checked in sequence. Only the first true condition’s block gets executed.
     - switch Statement: Used when you need to compare a single variable against multiple constant values. It’s cleaner and faster than using many else if conditions for discrete options.


SAMPLE OUTPUT:
        Identifying largest number-
        
                   Enter the value of a:
                   6
                   Enter the value of b:
                   9
                   Enter the value of c:
                   26
                   c is the largest number.
                   
        Identifying odd or even program-
        
                   Enter the number:
                   6
                   The given number is even number.

        Switch case program-

                   Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): +
                   Enter two numbers: 9 10
                   9 + 10 = 19 

       Switch case with break statement-

      vowel or constant program-

                  Enter a character.
                  a
                  The given character is a vowel.
                  
                        
CONCLUSION:
Decision-making statements are fundamental for writing flexible and intelligent C++ programs. They enable logic-based execution, allowing the program to make real-time choices based on given conditions.
